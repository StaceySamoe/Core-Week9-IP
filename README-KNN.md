#### Moringa Data Science Week-9 Independent Project - Stacey Samoe

#### Supervised Predictive Analysis - K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)

The aim of this project is to use the dataset provided; the titanic dataset, to predict whether someone survived or not. On the 15th of April 1912 the titanic sank after it collided with an iceberg. There was a total of 2,224 passengers, out of which 1,502 passed on. This project will help us predict who was likely to survived and who was not likely to survive. 


#### Setup/Installation Requirements

Please run the notebook on google colab. The data set is available at: 1. https://archive.org/download/train5_202002/train%20%285%29.csv 2.https://archive.org/download/test1_202002/test%20%281%29.csv, and can be downloaded. Python data science packages Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn were used to load the data set and do the analysis.
The K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) was used to model the dataset.
